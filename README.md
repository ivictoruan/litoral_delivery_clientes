👋 Hello there! Welcome to my README! 

📱 This is a mobile app made with Flutter 🦋 that aims to provide a delivery service for small towns in the state of Maranhão 🌴.

🚀 The app uses the MVVM architecture pattern 🏭, and the state management is handled by the ChangeNotifier 🔄 with the help of Provider for dependency injection 💉.


👨‍💻 To run the app, you'll need to have Flutter installed in your machine 💻. You can check how to install it on the official documentation: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

```

#🛍️ The app allows users: 
1. To register and login 🔑 [ ]
2. Browse restaurants and products available for purchase 🍔🍟 [✅]
3. Ad products to their shopping cart 🛒 [ ]
4. Finalize the purchase with the choice of delivery address and payment 💳 [ ]
